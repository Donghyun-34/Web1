  <p style="margin-top:45px;">Next, I will talk about the filming location of the movie. The filming locations are as follows.
  As you can see from the table, the main filming location is Ohio in the U.S. Filming took place from June 16 to September 10 of 1993.
  And from now on, I will talk about the storyline of the movie.
  Andy, a successful banker, is imprisoned in the Shawshank Prison accused of murdering his wife. After that, he had a hell of a life. And then, life becomes more convenient as he deals with the accounting affairs of the guards and prison warden. But, he goes through some kind of incident and escapes from prison. Afterward, the movie ends with enjoying the rest of he's life as planned before escaping.
  I like all about this movie, and my favorite thing is background music.
  The most representative of many background music is " Mozart: The Marriage of Figaro, " which appears in the scene where Andy gives some freedom to prisoners.
  In conclusion, today I talked about the movie "The Shawshank Redemption".
  To evaluate this movie, I gave five out of five.
  The reason is “overwhelming music”, “an enchanting performance” and “Mighty and very engaging story”.
  So, I recommend you watch this movie at home.
